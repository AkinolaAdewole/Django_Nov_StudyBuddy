render and redirect are functions provided by Django for rendering templates and 
performing redirects.
HttpResponse is used to return an HTTP response.
Room and Topic are Django models imported from models.py.
RoomForm is a Django form used for creating or updating rooms, imported from forms.py.
Functions:
1. home(request)
Retrieves all Room and Topic objects from the database and renders the 'index.html' template.
Passes rooms and topics to the template for display.
2. room(request, pk)
Retrieves a specific room using its primary key (pk).
Renders the 'room.html' template and passes the room object to display details of the specific room.
3. createRoom(request)
Creates a new RoomForm instance.
Handles form submission for creating a new room.
If the form data is valid, saves the form and redirects to the 'home' view.
Renders the 'room_form.html' template with the form if it's a GET request or the form is invalid.
4. updateRoom(request, pk)
Retrieves a specific room using its primary key (pk) and creates a RoomForm instance pre-filled with room data.
Handles form submission for updating the room details.
If the form data is valid, updates the room and redirects to the 'home' view.
Renders the 'room_form.html' template with the form if it's a GET request or the form is invalid.
5. deleteRoom(request, pk)
Retrieves a specific room using its primary key (pk).
If the request method is POST, deletes the room and redirects to the 'home' view.
Renders the 'delete.html' template to confirm the deletion action if it's not a 
POST request.
Please note, the commented-out code (e.g., the rooms list) seems to be placeholder data or old implementations that were previously \
used before the models were introduced. These comments might have served as a reference or initial implementation before database integration.

If you have any specific questions or need further clarification about any part of the code, feel free to ask!
